Documentation of the workspace 'NGA_W1_meta_data.mat'

This workspace has been created based on the PEER NGA database ground motions (Chiou et al. 2008). The documentation of the variables provided here is based on the NGA Documentation file available at:
http://peer.berkeley.edu/nga/documentation.html

Not all the variables available in the workspace may be required for the ground-motion selection. The minimum requirements have been documented in Select_Ground_Motions.m
