Documentation of the workspace 'BBP_***_meta_data.mat'

This workspace has been created based on the SCEC BBP results from the 13.5 and 13.6 studies using either the EXSIM, GP, or SDSU method (replace the '***' with the method name when choosing one of these databases).
 
Downloading simulated time histories for selected records

An account will be needed with the Southern California Earthquake Center in order to access the results from various ground motion simulations. The links provided in the Output file generated by the Select_Ground_Motions script lead to a list of simulation numbers, while the filenames displayed in the Output file indicate the folder number and
station (i.e. which links) to choose to access the appropriate time history. For each filename, the folder number will begin at 10000000 and the station number will appear after (e.g. for simulation 10000003.9001, 10000003 is the folder number and 9001 is the station number). Each of the time histories is located in a .acc file.

Note: The EXSIM meta data only includes one-component ground motions, and two-component selection will not work for this database. 
For single-component selection, the "Load the user-chosen database..." cell of the algorithm will need to be edited so that the soil_Vs30, magnitude, closest_D, and dirLocation variables are not repeated.  

Variables: 
 
Filename_1        : Filename of the time history data file in 				    direction 1
Filename_2        : Filename of the time history data file in 				    direction 2
dirLocation       : Link to the appropriate SCEC ground motion 				    simulation results page
Periods           : Periods at which spectral accelerations have 				    been computed and stored in the workspace
Rjb               : Joyner-Boore distance (km)
Sa_1              : Spectral acceleration in direction 1
Sa_2              : Spectral acceleration in direction 2
Sa_RotD100        : Orientation independent two-component 					    spectral acceleration
Sa_RotD50         : Orientation independent two-component 					    spectral acceleration
closest_D        : Closest distance to the ruptured area
magnitude         : Magnitude
soil_Vs30         : Vs30 value
