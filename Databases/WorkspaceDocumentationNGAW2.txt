Documentation of the workspace 'NGA_W2_meta_data.mat'

This workspace has been created based on the PEER NGA West 2 database ground motions The documentation of the variables provided here is based on the NGA Documentation file available at: http://peer.berkeley.edu/ngawest2/databases/

Not all the variables available in the workspace may be required for the ground-motion selection. The minimum requirements have been documented in Select_Ground_Motions.m

Downloading time histories for selected ground motions:

The instructions for downloading time series from the NGA-W2 database are summarized in the Output File. In order to retrieve the time histories for the ground motions ultimately selected, proceed to the link: ngawest2.berkeley.edu An account is needed to access the database. If you do not have an account, click "Sign-up" at the top of the page.
 
Once signed in, click the "NGA West2 enter" link on the right of the page. On the resulting page, select "No Scaling" under "Select Spectrum Model" and click submit. Under "Record Characteristics" enter the RSN (record sequence number) provided by the Output file generated by the Select_Ground_Motions script. The RSN values must be separated by commas. If you conducted a two-component ground motion selection, under "Suite, Spectral Ordinate" choose the type of orientation-independent spectra you used (i.e. RotD50 or RotD100). Click "Search Records."

On the resulting page, scroll down to "Download Options" located near the bottom of the page and click "Download Time Series Records." For any message boxes that appear, click "OK." Save the resulting files. Each file provides the number of points (NPTS) and time step (DT) of the time history.
